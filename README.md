# This project was created for Origin Energy

This is a more complete version of the Origin Energy front-end coding challenge. Total coding time is approx 10 hours to get to this stage. Tasks completed:

✅ Implement a page that renders a list of customer energy accounts.
✅ Fetch energy accounts from the backend.
✅ The accounts should be rendered in a Card UI format stacked on top of each other and centered on the page.
✅ The account balance should change color based on the value:
   - Positive: green
   - Negative: red
   - Zero: grey
✅ Implement a filter for filtering accounts by energy type.
✅ Clicking on the "Make a Payment" button should open a modal with:
   - title
   - credit card details
   - balance
   - A "Pay" button
✅ Implement a search feature to search by account address.

(Partial)
✅❌ Implement a different page/view that shows a history of payments made.

(Incomplete)
❌ Clicking the "Pay" button should submit the credit card details to the backend, and on success, show a “Payment Successful” view with a close button.

## Future Updates

With more time, I would do the following:
- ZOD schema on the credit card inputs to validate that the inputs are valid
- Updated UI to align with Origin Energy branding guidelines
- Complete the payment integration to adjust balances


Thanks,
